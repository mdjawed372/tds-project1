# GitHub Moscow Developers Analysis

* Data was scraped using GitHub's REST API v3, searching for users in Moscow with over 50 followers and their repositories, implementing rate limiting and pagination to ensure complete data collection.

* The most interesting finding is that Python is the most commonly used programming language among Moscow developers with high follower counts, followed by JavaScript and Go.

* Developers should consider adding detailed project documentation and wikis to their repositories, as the analysis shows that repositories with wikis tend to attract more stars and watchers.
